Setup:

 I compiled code onto an attiny85 and connected a RC low pass filter with a 3dB cut off at 20kHz
 in series with a 4 component chebyshev filter comprised of two inductors with values of 10uH and
 two capacitors with values of 22.2uF with 20% tolerances each.  I used an oscilloscope to validate
 the input frequency post RC filter that created an envelope wave form from the generated DDS square
 wave signal and then compared the result to the low pass chebyshev filter.

Test:

 The single point test I ran was with the current code compiled where in the code: Note = 1000. I took
 the attiny85 chip from the bread board programmer and placed it in the circuit and powered it on for
 at least ten seconds before verifying with an oscilloscope post RC filter to get characterize the wave 
 I was generating.

Results:

 The wave I generated post chebyshev filter had a dc offset of 1.8V with an amplitude wave of 513mV. This
 wave was attenuated from a post RC Filter signal where the amplitude wave was 567mVwhcih was filtered out
 as an envelope wave of a  4.16V signal  generated by the ATtiny85. The noise seen in the post RC filter 
 on top of the envelope wave is attributed to the 250 kHz sampling rate as seen by the post RC filter FFT. 
 With the addition of the Chebyshev filter the 250khz signal was filtered out with only a  9.5% attenuation
 of the amplitude wave. I do not know where the excess noise post Chebyshev filter comes from and warrants 
 further investigation

 I then ran this signal through the speaker as specified in the Major Bom to compare to the product 
 definition of being heard at an excess of 6ft away. The volume was almost unperceptively small and may suggest
 that an audio amplifier should be added to the circuit
